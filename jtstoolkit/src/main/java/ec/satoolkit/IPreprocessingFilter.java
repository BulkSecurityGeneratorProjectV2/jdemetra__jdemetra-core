/**
 * A pre-processing filter must extract from a pre-processing model the
 * information that will be used in the decomposition step and in the final
 * (reconciliation) step. Basically, the necessary information should be limited
 * to the part of the series that will be decomposed and to the parts of the
 * series that will be associated with the different components. Default
 * implementations will be straightforward. More sophisticated implementations
 * could include automatic corrections for seasonal effects, non standard
 * associations of the regression variables... The current implementation still
 * consider separate bias corrections. Such effects will be probably disappear
 * in future versions
