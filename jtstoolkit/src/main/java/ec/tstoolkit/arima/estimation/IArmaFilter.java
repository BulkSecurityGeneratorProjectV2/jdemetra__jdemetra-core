 * This interface defines methods used to compute the likelihood of data generated
 * by an arma model.
 * Suppose that y follows an ARMA model with covariance matrix V.
 * For computing the likelihood of y, we need log|V| and the ssq of
 * z=Ay, where A'A=V^-1 
 * 
 * The class defines the transformation z=A'y (filter),
 * the computation of the determinantal term (getLogDeterminant)
 * and returns the size of the (not computed) transformation A' (initialize)
