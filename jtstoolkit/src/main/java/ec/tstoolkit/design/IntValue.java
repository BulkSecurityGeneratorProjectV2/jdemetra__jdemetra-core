/**
 * Defines a class that can be represented by an int.<br>
 * This int can be just a sequence or have a special meaning. It is often used
 * to convert an enum to an int.<br>
 * Be aware that there is no point in comparing two ints from two different
 * classes. For example, <code>Frequency.intValue() > Gender.intValue()</code>
 * would compile and give a result but would not have a real meaning. Also note
 * that this class should have a constructor or a factory that uses an int as
 * sole parameter. For example, <code>Frequency.valueOf(int)</code>.
