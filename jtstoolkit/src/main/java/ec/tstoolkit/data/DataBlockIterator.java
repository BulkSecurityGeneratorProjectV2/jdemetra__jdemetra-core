/**
 * Iterator of data blocks. The underlying data block can be accessed by the 
 * "getData" method and moved by calls to other methods of the class.
 * It should be noted that the sliding of the data block is defined at the construction
 * of the iterator and applied to the current data block. So, in most cases,
 * only 1 call to getData() is required. It also means that that data block 
 * should be modified with much caution.
 * Example of use:
 * 
 * Matrix m=new Matrix(10, 6);
 * DataBlockIterator rows=m.getRows();
 * DataBlock row=rows.getData()
 * do{
 *    row.set(rows.getPosition()+1);
 * while (rows.next());
